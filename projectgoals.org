* Project: Mini MIDI Synth
Ideas:
- Have a drum machine section where it plays drum machine samples
- Play triangle/pulse/sine waves
- Play actual MIDI somehow
- Simple UI with 3–4 note buttons
** Week 1
Tasks:
1. Work on a related Figma design
- Most likely this will require a simple button layout --> Will start with a simple drum machine design first
- https://www.figma.com/design/Qkwr6QQSNTfhR24oD7ifAm/MidiBlazor-Figma?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=6nPrIK9vcMKU5lyP-0

2. Research NAudio or DryWetMIDI on macOS/.NET Core:
- 'NAudio' seems to be a solid option for using the .NET 'webapp' project.
- https://github.com/naudio/NAudio?tab=readme-ov-file
- Just as an update, this really would only help play audio on the C# backend side, but not in browser, so we are eliminating this option

3. Research whether or not it might be simpler to just play the audio in browser as well somehow:
- One example I found where they literally created a midi keyboard in browser in a Blazor app:
- https://kristofferstrube.github.io/Blazor.WebAudio/Keyboard
- https://github.com/KristofferStrube/Blazor.WebAudio/blob/main/samples/KristofferStrube.Blazor.WebAudio.WasmExample/Pages/Keyboard.razor
- Only problem with this approach is that it is absolutely overkill for what I need since I just wanna play audio somehow

** Week 2–3
Potential Features To Implement:
1. Get a simple button that when clicked results in a sampled drum machine sound's playback
2. Add a scrolling 'stock ticker' text section in the display just like the old school 90's drum machines, possible example to reference for animation ideas:

** Week 4
- Build standalone executable
- Write usage instructions

This is the related terminal command I used to create the app initially for reference:

#+begin_src bash
sam@Tinas-MacBook-Air ~/hub/MidiBlazor (main) $ dotnet new blazor -o DrumBlazor
#+end_src
